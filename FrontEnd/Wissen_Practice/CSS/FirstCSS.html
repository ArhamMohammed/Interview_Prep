            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to
            have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
            language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that
            compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
